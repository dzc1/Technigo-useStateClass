### The Purpose and Benefits of Utility Functions in React:

**What are utility functions in React?**

-   Utility functions in React are helper functions that are used to handle repetitive or common tasks, such as form input handling, data transformation, or side effects. They live outside of the component's render logic and can be reused across multiple components.

**Why do we use utility functions in React?**

-   **Code Reusability**: Utility functions promote the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by allowing the same logic to be used in multiple places, which leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: By abstracting logic into utility functions, we keep the component itself focused on rendering UI and managing state, leading to more readable components.
-   **Easier Testing**: Since utility functions are pure and stateless, they are easier to test compared to testing the whole component.

**How do we benefit?**

-   **Maintainability**: If form handling logic or input validation needs to change, you can update it in one place, rather than modifying each component that uses similar logic.
-   **Cleaner Components**: The components will only be concerned with rendering the UI, making them simpler and easier to follow.
