These global styles ensure a consistent look and feel across your entire app. On the other hand, for specific components that have unique styles (such as a custom button or card component), create individual CSS files or use CSS Modules. This allows you to encapsulate component-specific styles, avoiding conflicts with global styles and ensuring that component-level changes donâ€™t inadvertently affect other parts of your application.",
